# the index can be negative, positive, or zero
# -1 is first element in the back of the list
# ex. -1 gives us jim and -2 gives us karen.
# 0 gives kevin, 1 karen, 2 jim
# 1: gives us karen and jim but leaves out kevin
# it basically gives us a range to start or end on
# 1:3 gives all elements up to but not including 3rd index
